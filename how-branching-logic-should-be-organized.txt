Restrictions:

eval test < code
	can't run the code without first knowing if the test passes!

code < eval assert
	the assertion makes sure certain conditions hold after the code was run.

eval test < uneval test
	the test must be evaluated before it can be unevaluated!

eval assert < uneval assert
	same for the assertion! (as above)

uneval test < code
	don't know if the code will change the value of any variables in the test
	expression (that's why we have the assertion in the first place, so that if the
	code changes any, the assertion ensures reversibility is still possible), so it
	must be unevaluated before the code runs.


Result:

1. eval test
2. uneval test
3. code
4. eval assert
5. uneval assert


surprising, i know.
